# Albert DevCore and ADOS

Free local development infrastructure for ATLAS, NAVIRA, and future projects.

## Principles

- no paid AI APIs;
- Codex is used for architecture, critical code, and final verification;
- Ollama is limited to bounded read-only tasks;
- deterministic tools run before model work;
- context is assembled incrementally instead of rereading the repository;
- existing AGENTS.md and repository-specific rules remain authoritative;
- generated memory and analytics remain local by default;
- Windows PowerShell 5.1 compatibility is required.

## DevCore commands

```powershell
.\devcore.ps1 doctor
.\devcore.ps1 adopt -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo"
.\devcore.ps1 register -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo"
.\devcore.ps1 projects
.\devcore.ps1 update -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo"
.\devcore.ps1 route -Task "Review README wording"
.\devcore.ps1 packet -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo" -Task "Fix a friends bug"
.\devcore.ps1 local -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo" -Task "Review documentation" -Files @("README.md")
.\devcore.ps1 review -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo"
```

## ADOS commands

ADOS orchestrates DevCore, incremental indexes, project memory, verification evidence, local queues, audits, and handoffs. It prepares work and verifies evidence; it does not silently edit product code or call a paid model API.

```powershell
.\ados.ps1 doctor

.\ados.ps1 start `
  -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo" `
  -Task "Fix the error when adding a found user as a friend"

.\ados.ps1 analyze `
  -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo" `
  -Task "Prepare the next safe project stage"

.\ados.ps1 night `
  -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo"

.\ados.ps1 handoff `
  -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo"

.\ados.ps1 resume `
  -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo"

.\ados.ps1 verify `
  -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo" `
  -Task "Fix the friends flow" `
  -AllowedScope @("src\friends", "tests\friends") `
  -MaxVerificationLevel 3

.\ados.ps1 pr-summary `
  -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo"

.\ados.ps1 queue `
  -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo" `
  -QueueAction add `
  -Task "Prepare the next read-only audit" `
  -Priority normal

.\ados.ps1 benchmark `
  -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo" `
  -Task "Fix the friends flow"

.\ados.ps1 stats `
  -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo"

.\ados.ps1 failure `
  -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo" `
  -Task "Fix the friends flow" `
  -LogPath ".\test-output.log"

.\ados.ps1 remember-regression `
  -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo" `
  -Task "Fix the friends flow" `
  -RegressionCommand "npm test -- friends" `
  -Files @("src\friends.ts", "tests\friends.test.ts")

.\ados.ps1 remember-negative `
  -ProjectPath "C:\path\to\repo" `
  -Task "Fix the friends flow" `
  -Attempt "Change RLS" `
  -Outcome "Not the root cause" `
  -Files @("src\friends.ts")
```

`start` saves a pre-change checkpoint, detects the project adapter, refreshes local memory, builds symbol-aware elastic context, and creates the prompt packet and handoff. `verify` runs Scope Guard, the bounded Verification Ladder, and Evidence Gate, then writes a bounded PR evidence summary. `pr-summary` regenerates that summary without rerunning checks and marks it `NOT_READY` if the repository changed after Evidence Gate. A task is reported as `VERIFIED` only when required evidence was actually observed.

## ADOS modules

- Dispatcher: selects Codex, deterministic-first, or local-first execution.
- Change Detector: reads current Git state before broad repository context.
- Context Engine: generates maps, focused checks, and task packets.
- Repair Memory: indexes commit subjects and changed paths locally.
- Heat Map: ranks frequently and recently changed areas.
- Knowledge Graph: creates a lightweight import relationship graph.
- Fix DNA: records task terms, route, domains, and changed files.
- Night Audit: reports conflict markers, large files, TODOs, and repository status without editing code.
- Handoff: creates a resumable continuation packet.
- Incremental Hash Index: hashes source files and reuses imports and symbols when content did not change.
- Symbol Index: maps functions, classes, types, and other language-level declarations to files and lines.
- Elastic Context: chooses a risk-based budget, prioritizes repository entrypoints, and removes duplicate file content by SHA-256.
- Error Fingerprinting: normalizes failures into stable local signatures and recurrence counts.
- Regression Memory: links bugs, related files, and approved deterministic regression commands.
- ADR and Negative Memory: retrieves accepted decisions and rejected approaches relevant to the current task.
- Log Compressor: keeps the first root failure, useful stack frames, and repeat counts instead of full noisy logs.
- Scope Guard: compares post-checkpoint changes with explicit allowed scope and protected paths.
- Verification Ladder: stops at the requested level and records each observed check.
- Evidence Gate: refuses a verified status when diff, checks, scope evidence, or secret scanning is missing.
- PR Evidence Summary: creates a copy-ready local Markdown report and rejects stale Evidence Gate artifacts using a repository-state fingerprint.
- Project Adapters: detects ATLAS, NAVIRA, BPMN Studio, and generic web/mobile boundaries, supplies repository entrypoints, and never rewrites project settings.
- Checkpoint and Resume: records task, branch, HEAD, baseline changes, and continuation phase.
- Queue Engine: maintains a local priority queue; queue inspection never executes a task by itself.
- Night Mode: refreshes indexes, decisions, audits, queue status, and usage summaries without model calls or product-code changes.
- Usage Analytics: records local stage duration and byte-selection estimates, not claimed billing data.
- A/B Benchmark: compares fixed lexical selection with elastic symbol-aware selection using deterministic proxy metrics.

Architecture details are in `docs/ADOS_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Generated local files

ADOS may create files under:

```text
.ai/context/
.ai/memory/
.ai/analytics/
.ai/local-output/
.ai/index/
.ai/evidence/
.ai/checkpoints/
.ai/queue/
```

The orchestrator adds them to `.git/info/exclude` so they remain local even when a project does not yet contain shared ignore rules.

## Trust boundary

DevCore and ADOS do not give local models permission to modify product code. Local-model output, generated dependency maps, historical similarity, Heat Map scores, and audit findings are advisory until verified against source code, deterministic checks, and Codex review.

Security, authentication, permissions, RLS, migrations, production, releases, financial logic, dependencies, and architecture remain protected domains.

Built-in adapters add project-specific protected boundaries. ATLAS keeps live trading, broker access, real money, and risk gates protected. NAVIRA keeps Supabase RLS, SQL migrations, authentication, notifications, and production EAS builds protected. These adapters are advisory and do not modify the projects. A future project can provide `.ados/adapter.json` using `template/.ados/adapter.example.json` as a starting point.

## Verification

Run the deterministic integration fixture under Windows PowerShell 5.1:

```powershell
.\tests\ados-smoke.ps1
```

The test creates an isolated Git fixture under `tests/.work/`, exercises the complete v0.3 pipeline, and expects `ADOS v0.3 smoke test: PASS`.

Pull requests that touch ADOS code run the same parser and smoke checks on a standard Windows runner using Windows PowerShell 5.1. The workflow is deterministic, read-only outside its disposable fixture, and does not call a model or paid API.

`rg` remains the preferred fast search path. When it is unavailable, prompt-packet candidate discovery falls back to bounded native PowerShell scanning, so a clean Windows machine can still run ADOS without installing another tool.
